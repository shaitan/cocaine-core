cocaine-core (0.12.14.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Feature: atomic service publish on startup.
    This commit changes the core bootstrap mechanism by making its service
    publishing atomic. That means that there will be no service
    announce/exposing before all of them are ready, i.e. completed their
    constructors without exceptions. Doing so protects us from the case,
    when an application, which requires some service (which is not exposed
    yet) has been started and tries to resolve that service, which results
    in errors.
    Now there will be no user load to the node before it is completely
    bootstrapped.
  * Fixed: fixed race condition when an "expose" event on the same service
    can be delivered after the "remove" one.
  * Fixed: fixed race condition when an actor action tries to access parent
    members while the parent has already died.
  * Changed: add direct bind method (#181).
    This commit adds additional bind method to the trace implementation
    that wraps the given function directly without intermediate `std::bind`.
  * Changed: terminate immediately during bootstrap (#180).

cocaine-core (0.12.14.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Feature: added load counter metric for services.
  * Changed: optimized connection acceptance mechanism.
    Previously a separate thread for each Cocaine actor was spawned for
    accepting connections. Except this it mostly did nothing. Now there
    is a single thread in the Context that provides a living room for all
    connection acceptors which work asynchronously.
    Doing so allows for us for reduce the number of threads by
    approximately 2/3.
  * Changed (BREAKING): no more a separate actor class for servers that
    listen Unix sockets.
  * Changed: using exponentially decaying accumulator for session timer
    metrics.
  * Changed: Locator will now delay relinking nodes using exponential-backoff
    timeout.

cocaine-core (0.12.13.0-alpha1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Feature: protocol extension (#152).
    This change applies protocol extension frames similar to HTTP/2.
    Implemented as a protocol extension frames, that allows sessions to
    adjust their settings externally, revoke channels etc.
    - Added new protocol - control.
    - For all prime protocols new events are pushed back with event id
    descending from 2**16-1. Such agreement guarantees that no one will be
    broken during applying new scheme.
    - The previous requirement forces us to use MPL map instead of type
    lists for managing protocol event numbers.
    - Transition states, such as `primitive<T>` or `streaming<T>` are now
    required to be marked with `transition_type` to be properly handled by
    cocaineâ€™s machinery.
    - New events are intentionally allowed for an end user to be called.
    - Implemented channel revocation.
  * Feature: feat: verbose logging using trace bit (#150).
    A new HPACK header is now analyzed: a `trace_bit` of a boolean type.
    Putting such header triggers verbose mode, when all logs are written
    with no severity check. This mimics the previous logic, when the same
    behavior was achieved just by presence of a `trace_id` header.
  * Feature: add `dynamic_t` constructors from maps with non-string, but
    still convertible-to-string, keys.
  * Feature: extend format functionality with traits.
    Now `cocaine::format` can use newly introduced `display_traits`
    specializations of  for fine-grained formatting.
  * Feature: allow the `context_t` to insert with initializers (#162).
    This is useful to atomically check-and-insert new services, especially
    for Node service.
  * Changed: storage authorization now uses identities instead of just UIDs.
  * Changed: event authorization now uses identities too (#157).
  * Changed: deferred and streamed wrappers no longer throw exceptions
    and return with error code instead (#151).
  * Changed: upstreams are now able to demolish session in emergency
    case (#156).
  * Changed: no longer `const` hell in dispatches, because they are mutable in
    common case.
  * Fixed: storage with authorization is async again (#154).
    Storage authorization check internally uses storage backend for
    fetching/saving ACLs and it was implemented using synchronous storage
    methods, which may freeze current executionâ€™s thread. This change
    returns back asynchronous behavior.
  * Fixed: tag ACL collection for storages (#163).
    This allows to perform migrations in the future in the case of changed
    format.

  * New internal service - Runtime - responsible for gathering metrics from the

    the asynchronous logging; the second one - is custom configurable via config
    filters, which makes logging routing easy.

cocaine-core (0.12.3.7+nmu1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Hotfix: clear msgpack zone every decode iteration.
    We have to clear msgpack zone every decoding iteration to prevent memory
    leaking for objects structure, cause they have no way to notify about
    self destruction. Hope someday we migrate to v1.* and everything will be
    fine automatically.
    It's also recommended to rebuild all your dependencies, because the
    changed file is a part of public API and implicitly marked as inline,
    which may result in unexpected behavior.

cocaine-core (0.12.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

    If an actor frequently accepts new connections there was a chance that
    it would be deadlock'ed while terminating, because the actor's accepting

cocaine-core (0.12.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: fixed packing typelists with implicit convertions.
    These changes may affect clients which depend on packing typelists using
    implicit conversion rules; error codes, for example. If you depend from
    typelist packing for types other than error codes, it's highly recommended
    to recompile your services, cause these symbols may be inlined into the code
    giving some weird protocol mismatch errors.

cocaine-core (0.12.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 12.0.
  * Multithreaded Actor I/O. All incoming messages are now dispatched on a
    shared thread pool, which greatly speeds the things up.
  * Protocol transitions. Service protocols can now specify state transitions
    to support dispatch hierarchies. For example, storage protocol can
    implement a write_stream() method, which switches to stream protocol on
    invocation, or Chrono Service can implement a cancellable_timeout() method
    by switching to a cancellable protocol.
  * App streaming interface. Clients can stream data chunks into the app now,
    as opposed to sending a single request chunk along with the enqueue()
    method invocation.
  * Dropped libev in favor of Boost.ASIO.
  * Logging in now handled via the Blackhole logging library.
  * Locator is now a proper service, without any special treatment. Local
    service management is a responsibility of the Context.
  * Configurable cluster discovery mechanics, including multicast and predefine
    cluster discovery plugins.
  * Routing groups re-implemented using Ketama consistent hashing continuums.

  * ZeroMQ has gone completely.
  * Cocaine is no longer standalone. Multiple nodes can be linked together to
    form a cloud, at last. When an app requests a service which is not local,
    a request is made to resolve the specified service remotely.
  * Apps are now exposed as services by default. If a specific application
    should not be published, set the 'local' flag in the manifest.
  * Named queues. Drivers can now enqueue their sessions to a specific worker
    with some human-readable name. The sessions in named queues will be pumped
    before any anonymous sessions in the engine's shared queue.
  * The Locator can now be bound to a configurable port, allowing users to get
    multiple Runtimes on a single host.

cocaine-core (0.10.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.4.
  * Slave output capturing. When a slave crashes, its stdout and stderr output

  * Storage API v2. The list() method was superseded by the find() method,
    which supports tags and indexing. New blobs can be tagged via a new
    parameter to write().
